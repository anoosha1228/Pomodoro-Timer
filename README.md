# Pomodoro-Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.

In this code users can input their desired pomodoro time, short and long breaks. And set as many intervals as they want.

Enjoy studing!
